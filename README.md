## KEY INSIGHTS 
- After extensive data analysis and modeling, here are the main findings:

### 1. **Large Population Lacks Basic Water Access**
- Only 22% of Maji Ndogoâ€™s population has access to basic water services, especially in rural areas.
- **Contaminated wells**, **broken infrastructure**, and **long queues at shared taps** are key limiting factors.
- Urban areas are better served, but still show gaps due to aging infrastructure or inadequate coverage.

### 2. **Improving Water Access Requires Targeted Interventions**
- The data reveals **which specific source types** need improvement. For example: 
- **Shared taps with >30 min queue times** need upgrades or expansion.
- **Contaminated wells** must be cleaned or replaced.
- **Public taps** should be prioritized in high-density rural areas.

### 3. **Rural Areas Incur Higher Costs**
- Cost modeling shows that improving water sources in **rural areas costs 50% more**, due to remoteness and logistics.
- Budget adjustments account for this, ensuring fair resource allocation.

### 4. **Impact Can Be Quantified**
- We calculated the **potential improvement in basic water access** if all planned upgrades are completed.
- For example, upgrading X number of sources can increase basic access by **Y%**, directly impacting tens of thousands of lives.

### 5. **Provincial Reports Enable Localized Decision-Making**
- Each province has unique water challenges.
- The report supports **drill-through to provincial pages**, allowing local leaders to:
- See the **total population affected**.
- Understand **budget needs by town**.
- View **source type distribution** and **gender-specific safety issues**.
- Track progress against planned improvements.
